Requirements:
1. Generate exactly {sample_size} test cases
2. Each prompt must be a realistic customer query (15-50 words)
3. Each golden_response must follow the nested array structure exactly
4. Distribute test cases across these categories:
   - Account access and security
   - Billing and payments
   - Product functionality
   - Technical issues
   - Service upgrades/downgrades
5. Every value must be a string except for:
   - response_time_seconds (number)
   - next_steps (array of strings)

Return ONLY a parseable JSON array. No explanation text.'''

CONV_GENERATOR_PROMPT = '''You are a conversation test case generator for customer service interactions. Generate conversation pairs in the exact format specified.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
[
    [
        ["id", "use the ID provided in input"],
        ["prompt", "customer query text"],
        ["golden_response", "customer service agent response text"],

Example Output:
[

I can see the duplicate charge in our system and I'll process the refund immediately. The refund should appear in your account within 3-5 business days. I'm also adding a note to your account to prevent this from happening again. Would you like me to send you an email confirmation of the refund?"],
        ["test_case", "conversation"]
    ]
]

Requirements:
1. Generate exactly {sample_size} test cases
2. Each prompt must be a realistic customer query (15-50 words)
3. Each golden_response must be comprehensive (50-150 words) and include:
   - Acknowledgment of the issue
   - Clear empathy statement
   - Specific solution steps
   - Verification question or follow-up offer
4. Cover provided scenario categories: {scenarios}

Return ONLY a parseable JSON array. No explanation text.'''


VALIDATOR_PROMPT = '''You are a test case validator for customer service interactions. You MUST output ONLY a JSON array of test case validations in the specified format.

Required Output Format:
[
    [
        ["id", "exact ID from input test case"],
        ["prompt", "exact prompt from test case"],
        ["prompt_quality_score", <integer 1-5>],
        ["response", "exact response from test case"],
        ["response_quality_score", <integer 1-5>]
    ]
]

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
1. Use ONLY arrays, no objects with curly braces
2. Each key-value pair must be a two-element array
3. All strings must use double quotes
4. Quality scores must be integers between 1 and 5
5. Each test case must be a complete array of key-value pairs
6. No trailing commas
7. No line breaks within values

Example of correct formatting:
[
    [
        ["id", "12345"],
        ["prompt", "How do I reset my premium account?"],
        ["prompt_quality_score", 5],
        ["response", "I understand you need help resetting your premium account. Here's how..."],
        ["response_quality_score", 4]
    ]
]

Follow this format EXACTLY. Any deviation will cause parsing errors. Only respond with JSON.'''

REPORT_GENERATOR_PROMPT = '''You are a technical report writer specializing in AI/ML model evaluation. 
Generate a comprehensive, professional report in Markdown format analyzing benchmark results. 
The metrics you are receiving is the output of an A/B test of two models against a golden dataset. 
Responses were generated 3 times for each prompt and then combined together for analysis to account
for the account for the probabalistic output of LLMs within text generation.

Focus on:
- BLEU scores as primary metric for translation/response quality
- WER (Word Error Rate) as measure of response accuracy
- Other supplementary metrics in context

Required Markdown Sections:
# Executive Summary
# Methodology
## Feature Configuration
## Test Approach
# Metrics Analysis
## BLEU Score & WER Analysis
## Additional Metrics
# Results & Findings
# Recommendations

Guidelines:
- Be data-driven and specific
- Compare model performances
- Highlight significant patterns
- Explain metric implications for real-world use
